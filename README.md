# gm_f1atgrass
This is the testbed for gm_voxelate, a configurable voxel module for Garrysmod.

##Voxelate Pre-Release
Currently this repo also serves as the pre-release for gm_voxelate. Only windows binaries are available at the moment.

See the Facepunch Thread for more information.

##Installation

1. Download/clone repo into garrysmod/addons.

2. Download gmsv_voxelate_win32.dll and gmcl_voxelate_win32.dll from the repo's releases page. These modules are identical, but both are required to use voxelate in singleplayer. Place them in garrysmod/lua/bin.

##Usage

Start gmod and run the gm_f1atgrass map. You will spawn with the VOXGUN, which can be used to place and remove blocks like you can in minecraft. Currently there is no way to select a different block type to place.
